# Glenn Berry's Diagnostic Scripts
Glenn Berry has provided the community with his famous diagnostic scripts for years, you can check out [Glenn's Blog](https://glennsqlperformance.com/blog/)  to check out his work and to get in touch with him.

> This section contains his scripts in a notebook format (check out the article on how they're made [here](https://tsql.tech/sql-notebooks-on-the-right-track-to-enhance-data-analysis-on-sql-server/) )

If you want to understand how to better run and interpret these queries, you should consider listening to Glenn's related [Pluralsight courses](https://www.pluralsight.com/training/Courses), which are [Azure SQL Database: Diagnosing Performance Issues with DMVs](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/azure-sql-database-diagnosing-performance-issues-dmvs), [SQL Server 2017: Diagnosing Performance Issues with DMVs](https://bit.ly/2FqCeti), [SQL Server 2017: Diagnosing Configuration Issues with DMVs](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/sqlserver-diagnosing-configuration-issues-dmv), [SQL Server 2014 DMV Diagnostic Queries – Part 1](http://app.pluralsight.com/courses/sql-server-2014-dmv-diagnostic-queries-part1), [SQL Server 2014 DMV Diagnostic Queries – Part 2](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/sql-server-2014-dmv-diagnostic-queries-part2), and [SQL Server 2014 DMV Diagnostic Queries – Part 3](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/sql-server-2014-dmv-diagnostic-queries-part3). All five of these courses are pretty short and to the point, at 91, 164, 106, 67, 77, and 68 minutes respectively. Listening to these six courses is really the best way to thank Glenn for maintaining and improving these scripts…
