The [session_id] and [request_id] columns are, of course, SQL Server’s way of doing this, while the rest of the columns are more human-readable. Note that [request_id] will almost always have a value of 0 for active requests (those where the [status] column has any value other than “sleeping”), and NULL for sleeping sessions. This is not quite the same as the way the data is represented in the sysprocesses DMV, but I don’t think it makes sense to have any [request_id] when there is no request. To see a value greater than 0, you’ll have to use MARS in your application. Not a common thing, which is why this column shows up on the far righthand side of the output.</p>\n",

The [tempdb_allocations] column is collected directly from the tempdb-related DMVs, and indicates how many pages were allocated in tempdb due to temporary tables, LOB types, spools, or other consumers. The [tempdb_current] column is computed by subtracting the deallocated pages information reported by the tempdb DMVs from the number of allocations. Seeing a high number of allocations with a small amount of current pages means that your query may be slamming tempdb, but is not causing it to grow. Seeing a large number of current pages means that your query may be responsible for all of those auto-grows you keep noticing.</li>\n",

It can be used not only to tell whether the session has an active transaction, but also to find out how deeply nested the transaction is. This is invaluable information when debugging situations where applications open several nested transactions and don’t send enough commits to seal the deal.</li>"
