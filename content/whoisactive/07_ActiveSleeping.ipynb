Who is Active collects data in two phases, and in newer builds I decided that if some activity is caught on the first pass, it should be reported even if the session has disconnected, or a new and different request started, by the second pass. The second phase generally begins only a few milliseconds after the first, but on active OLTP systems it’s common for most requests to not even take that long. The goal is to report as much data as possible. These almost-completed (or almost-disconnected) sessions look like this:</p>\n",

The giveaway that something changed by the second phase? CPU, reads, and writes are all NULL. That means that a suitable matching row didn’t exist in either sys.dm_exec_requests or sys.dm_exec_sessions by the time the second phase kicked in—so the session must have either disconnected or started a new request. When this happens the [dd hh:mm:ss.mss] column reports the time elapsed since the session originally logged in. It’s the only interesting time metric I can get when this occurs.</p>\n",

Why is the application beginning transactions and letting them sit around for long periods of time? This is generally not a great I idea, for a number of reasons that I hope are rather obvious to anyone reading this post.</p>"
