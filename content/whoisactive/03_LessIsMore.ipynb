If you installed it on a test server, or your laptop, or some other non-production machine, you’re probably not going to see any output in the default mode because there is nothing to show you. There are no active requests, and no one has started a transaction and left it sitting around waiting for Who is Active to drop by and monitor. <b>The lack of output in this case is a good thing. </b>It means that you don’t have to waste your time trying to find the meaningful information in a sea of worthless data. <a href=\"/docs/02_design\">I explained this previously in the article on design philosophy.</a></p>\n",
