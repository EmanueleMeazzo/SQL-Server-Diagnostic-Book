And the opposite is true: a lack of options makes for a dull, ineffective, one-trick solution. Case in point? sp_who and sp_who2 had only <i>one parameter each</i>. The super-dull \"@loginame [sic].\" Yes, those crazy kids at Microsoft left out an \"n,\" but it's not like the parameter was well-named. After all, it wasn't just a filter on a login name; it could also be a SPID, or it could be the word \"active,\" which would make it show all sessions that weren't sleeping (including system sessions). Thanks for the straightforward user experience, Microsoft!</p>\n",
