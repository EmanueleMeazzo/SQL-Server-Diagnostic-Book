In the interest of performance and flexibility I was forced to take what was once a single SQL statement and convert it to utilize dynamic SQL, temporary tables, cursors, error handling, XML, and various other features. Throughout the entire process I’ve attempted to adhere, whenever possible, to a set of basic design principles. These are covered below.    <br></p>\n",

These tools all have one thing in common that makes them much less useful than they could have been: They show <i>every session</i> that’s connected to the SQL Server instance—whether or not any work is being done. On smaller SQL Server instances this doesn’t matter; you get used to ignoring the various system processes, and figure out where to focus to get the pay dirt—information on what your users are actually up to. But some bigger instances, especially those that back numerous application servers using connection pooling, can have hundreds or thousands of connected, sleeping sessions.</p>\n",

You need to see what’s actively happening on the server, not who has connected and left a session open anytime in recent days. So from the very first versions of Who is Active I simply filtered out anything that was sleeping, with one exception: Sleeping sessions may be holding an open transaction, in which case they may have resources locked. </p>\n",

We’ll get to tasks in a later post, but in the meantime consider this: <b>The same exact information has been reported numerous times</b>. There are not, in fact, numerous sessions using session ID 54, each of which are connected to ADAM03 and each of which are running some kind of SELECT. This is extraneous information that just makes our job of figuring out what’s going on that much more difficult. Even worse, all of those numbers (the CPU and DiskIO columns, in case you’re wondering) are each populated at the task level. If you needed to debug at the task level—and in practice, as an end-user you very, very rarely do—that would be great. But for most of us, a single, aggregated CPU time number works fine, thank you very much. (Assuming, of course, that these CPU numbers are even accurate.)</p>\n",

I’ve decided against showing the CPU and disk I/O columns in this screen shot because the values are both 0—it turns out that these numbers are quite often reported inaccurately for parallel requests, so the newer DMVs don’t show them in this case.

Unfortunately, they also provide you with virtually no useful data with which to debug issues, so you might have been better off never looking to begin with. Profiler is the opposite: it can give you lots of data with which to debug, but can also cause the entire instance to grind to a halt.</p>\n",

In order to accomplish this I’ve disabled automatic creating of statistics on all of the temp tables, employed dirty reads to avoid having the tool block or wait for a lock to be released, used hints to control memory allocations, and use cursors (not so evil after all!) in conjunction with error handling to process certain data in a more granular fashion. </p>\n",

I’ve pruned down this set and have tried to include only those pieces of information that are actually valuable in the vast majority of cases. I don’t want the default Who is Active output to have so many columns that it’s difficult to read and understand. And I don’t want to have to process so much data that things slow down. For this same reason, a lot of the Who is Active features are not enabled by default. If you need a bit more data, it’s usually just a matter of figuring out which parameter to set.</p>\n",
