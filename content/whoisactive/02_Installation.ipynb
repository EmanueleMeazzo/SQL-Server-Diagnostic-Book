In most cases there is no reason to avoid granting this privilege to a user; the main concern is situations where a user might be able to harvest private information by looking at SQL text, especially when it is non-parameterized. These cases being quite few and far between, I consider this to be a relatively low barrier to entry.</p>\r\n",

When these are used, the stored procedure will attempt to access the database in which the lock or blocking is occurring, in order to resolve the affected object names.
